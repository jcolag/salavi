# Salavi
An ancient board game...with a twist.

The **Salavi** project exists to build on the classic [**Snakes and Ladders**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_ladders) game.  To avoid needing to constantly tweak HTML code manually, this code generates the game boards of various sizes.

When the game works, `generate.js` will probably evaporate, with one final layout chosen---or a dynamic layout created---instead.
